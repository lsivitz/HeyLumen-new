I'm motivated by success; mainly, that is, the prospect of it. The actual **achieving** of things usually goes by unnoticed: by the time achievement happens, the prospect has already become normalized in my mind.

I have a feeling this is a common thing for intrinsically-motivated people. When one's motivation comes from extrinsic sources, the stakeholders in your task are generally not satisfied until completion, delaying your dopamine rush until they showcase their pleasure.

How can we intrinsically-motivated souls get our big task-finishing dopamine rush and use it as further motivation during low times? I've got a simple framework:

**Combating Moving Goalposts**
As the truism states, "you make what you measure," so if we want to make progress and maintain a sense of it, we need to measure what we're after.

Step 1: Set the big goal
This probably looks something like, "Build X" or "Learn Y". It can be as big as you want!

Step 2: Chunk it
Measuring and estimating big things is hard, so let's make it easier by breaking our big thing into small bits. For "Build X" we may have, "Design A", "Talk to B", "Build X-c". You can repeat this process and chunk your chunks as necessary if you're tackling a particularly big effort.

Step 3: Determine timeframes for your chunks
While your enthusiasm is still high, think through each chunk. "What will I have to do to get this done?" Estimate timeframes for the knowns, guesstimate timeframes for the unknowns. Anytime you guesstimate, double what you come up with.

Step 4: Add up your timeframes
You should have a timeframe for every chunk. Add them together, then ask yourself, "If this took me twice as long, would I still be happy I did it?" If the answer is yes, double whatever your timeframes total to. This is KEY -> we're trying to set realistic expectations and then **feel happy** when we achieve them. If you'd be happy to take twice as long, why not build that in to your expectations?

Step 5: Make a physcial artifact
You've done the hard work of planning, now do the easy work of documenting how things feel, now, at the beginning of the journey. Write your goal at the top of a piece of paper. List out all the chunks underneath it, along with your estimated timeframes & checkboxes next to each chunk. At the bottom, write the date that corresponds with your estimated completion (taking into account any doubling you've done!).

When you finish a chunk, check it off the list. When you discover a new, unexpected chunk en route to your finshed effort, add it to the list, note how long it took, and check it off too.

DEALING WITH DISCOURAGEMENT
When you find yourself down, lacking motivation, or feeling generally discouraged, look at your artifact. Does it still feel accurate? If not, where is it off? If it's not off, but you're FEELING off, read between the lines of the artifact. Do you see your own enthusiasm? Do you still have time to meet your original goal?
Focus on the original goalposts!

FINISHING
When you're all done, look at your artifact. Look at your time estimate. Did you beat it? Did you miss it but still finished? WOW - you finished! Frame that artifact ;)
