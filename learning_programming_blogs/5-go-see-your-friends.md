I have a problem, and you may have this problem, too: when I'm feeling low, I'm **less** likely to reach out to my friends to chat than when I'm feeling good.

This is remarkably silly, as there's nothing like talking with someone who genuinely cares to lift one's spirits.

Why do I turn into a recluse when things feel hard? That's a tough question to answer, but fortunately, it doesn't seem that knowing the answer prerequisite for feeling better: **Just** **talk** **to** **your** **friends**.

I met with a friend today - someone I hadn't spoken with since Covid started 6 months ago - and our conversation was immediately soothing: "How have you been?" "Ah, I've been a bit rough over the last couple of weeks." Just saying it out loud helped. Then, "How's your family?" "My dad has been pretty ill, so that's been weighing on me." "Sorry to hear that. I know how you feel, my dad has been sick, too."

WOW - turns out my struggles aren't unique, my friend wants to commiserate, to make jokes to lighten things up, to offer help where he could. All the perspective-shifting I needed, right there in an hour-long converation, outside, 6+ feet apart.

Why didn't I call him last week? I was too busy wallowing in my apartment. So, I'm writing this as a note to both of us, myself and you: Call your friend. Don't wait until you're feeling better, give your friends the pleasure of helping you. They'll love that you called, and you will too.
